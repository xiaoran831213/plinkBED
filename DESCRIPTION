Description: The BED triplets (*.bed, *.bim, and *.fam) is one of the major formats to store genome data, which came with the whole genome analysis software PLINK. This package allows to read the genome data stored in BED into a R matrix. To be simple and self-dependent, the basic BED reader provided does not handle huge, out-of-memory BED triplets. To gain more powerful control such as file backed virtual R matrix, and sample/variant subseting, refer to package "BEDMatrix".
